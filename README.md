### Tools used
I originally got the Canada map SVG from [here](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Canada_blank_map.svg)

If you don't like the size of the current SVG data in the canada-map-final.js file you can resize it. There are a number of ways to do this. The options include using [this](http://svg-edit.googlecode.com/svn/branches/2.6/editor/svg-editor.html) great online SVG editor.

The second option is the great command line tool [SVG Resizer](https://github.com/vieron/svg-resizer).

To use your SVG file with Raphael.js you can use this handy site [readysetraphael.com](www.readysetraphael.com) which will let you upload an SVG and spit out a the .js file you need.
